# An SPA that displays employee's data

Build a Single Page Application displaying an employee dataset in the following format:
- Chart View:
  * The first tab should show a bar chart of the dataset where the x axis represents the locations and the y axis represents salaries.
- Table View:
  * The second tab should show a table view of the same data where salaries are aggregated by location.
  * The salary column should also contain a delta value showing the percentage change from the last salary to the current one.
  * There should be a last row in the table containing the total salaries for all locations.

Additionally, we would like you to build filtering capability using a dropdown containing all locations. 
By default, all locations are displayed on the chart and table. When selecting a location, both chart and table show the data relevant to the selected location.

## Provided

To save you time, we have provided the following things:
- A React boilerplate application skeleton
- A dataset where each datapoint is the data of a single employee
- A dropdown component that you can use as a filter
- A design mockup for the table view

## Requirements

- The application must work 
- The code should be production ready (tested, documented, etc)
- The UI should look as close as possible to the design provided
- The application should have a great UX 

Good luck!
